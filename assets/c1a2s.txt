The Fairy Queen has arrived!
Suddenly, with the tinkling sound of her wings, the Fairy Queen flew down.
Her wings are so shiny.
The Fairy Queen flew over to the Junior Fairies
and tapped each one on their shoulders with her magic wand.
Each bud opened and turned into a wing of pale gold.
Mary felt a tingle as her wings opened up.
They are still wet so Mary needs your help.
