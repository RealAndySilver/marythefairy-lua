All the other fairies began to wiggle their wings and that made them lift off the ground.
Mary could feel that her wings were ready. They made a buzzing sound and felt all twitchy.
Mary tried wiggling her wings up and down like the other fairies, but she couldn't lift off.
No matter how hard she tried, Mary couldn't lift off the ground.
The Fairy Queen fluttered her big golden wings and the wind they made lifted Mary off the ground.
But she needs more help.
Would you like to help Mary to fly?
