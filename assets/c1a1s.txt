Mary gets her wings!
Mary is a Junior Fairy.
Junior Fairies have little buds on their shoulders, which turn into wings when they turn five.
I can't wait to turn five. It will be easier to do my duties when I get my wings.
Mary is very excited because she is turning five today.
Once a year, the Junior Fairies gather for the wing ceremony at the Fairy Queen's Silver Palace.
All the Fairies waited under the toadstool in the Silver Palace Garden.
Mary looked around the garden and giggled at the strange sights.
There were blue kittens chasing purple dogs and pink bunnies chasing yellow frogs.
